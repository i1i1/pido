# Pido

Pido is rust program which generates image with 2 genetic algorithms:

1. One is for triangulization of image
2. Another is for coloring of triangles

## Running

In order to run it give it an image and wait some time (for me 512x512 image took about 1-2 hours).

```sh
cargo run --release -- ./refernce_image.png
```

Then checkout `output.png`
